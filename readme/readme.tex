The replication file consists the codes and helper files to replicate the Monte Carlo simulations for success of Maximal Clique and HF method. The codes can be decomposed to three steps; data generating, analyzing and evaluating. Outputs of the first two steps are files saved in disk and the last step are tables consist of evaluations.

The codes are designed in R project version 3.11 and Gauss 10 for Windows and developed in Windows 7 64bit. To run the code trouble-free, the following requirements must be satisfied.
\begin{flushleft}
	\large Requirements
\end{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
\item R project, Gauss for Windows
\item Following packages for R: "igraph", "fUnitRoots", "stringr", "rugarch", "parallel"
\item Gauss should be installed in directory C:/, not any subdirectory of C:/ (since the code utilizes Gauss by calling C:/gauss10/tgauss)

\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
	\large Usage
\end{flushleft}
Run all the commands in main.R. The file contains commands used for data generating, analyzing and evaluating for both method and each data type. The results are saved in Results folder as csv file. NOTE: The tables in these files are re-formed for the paper but both shares same outline.

\begin{flushleft}
