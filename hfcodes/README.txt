This pack contains Gauss programmes (for version 6.0) to compute the statistics proposed in
PESARAN, "A SIMPLE PANEL UNIT ROOT TEST UNDER CROSS SECTION DEPENDENCE",
FEBRUARY 2006, as well as the statistics in the Tables therein.

(1) "real_exchange_7398.xls": Excel file contains 17 OECD countries real exchange rate.

(2) "CADF_Tables.txt": a gauss programme file to reproduce CD statistics and CIPS
	statistics of Table 10,11,14 and more in Pesaran (2006). This requires data (1).

(3) "CADF_Tables_out.txt": output you will obtain after running (2).

(4) "CIPSmarch06.prc": a gauss procedure to compute CADF(p)_i, CIPS(p),
	and the truncated version of those. See the head of the file.

(5) "IPSmarch06.prc": a gauss procedure to compute ADF(p)_i, tbar(p),
	and the truncated version of those. See the head of the file.

(6) "BaiNg02.prc": a gauss procedure to estimate the number of factors using
	the information criteria in Bai and Ng (2002). See the head of the file.

(7) "PU_MP04.prc": a gauss procedure to panel unit root tests, proposed by
	Moon and Perron (2004). See the head of the file.

On 16 May 2007, GAUSS procedure for CZ and CP test statistic and their critical values are added:

(8) "cz_cp.prc": a gauss procedure to compute CZ and CP test, based on CADF(p)_i statistic obtained 
	by (4). See the head of the file.

(9) "CVTable_CZ_CP.xls": Critical Value Table for CZ and CP test.

It would be appreciated if one could acknowledge the use of the code in his/er research.
